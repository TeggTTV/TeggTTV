# 👋 Hi, I'm Joey!

I'm a developer who loves building useful tools and cool websites. I enjoy working on SaaS products, especially ones that help small businesses and creators. At night, I brainstorm ideas and bring them to life with code.

## 🌟 My Latest Project

### [📦 Inventory Tracker](https://inventory-tracker-saas.vercel.app)

This web app helps small businesses keep track of their inventory in a simple and easy way. This is currently just a landing page but I might make this a functional app in the future.

Check it out: [inventory-tracker-saas.vercel.app](https://inventory-tracker-saas.vercel.app)

## 🔧 What I Like to Build

- 🛠️ SaaS tools
- 🧠 Smart, simple dashboards
- 🎮 Game tools and mods
- 📅 Calendars and organizers

## 🚀 More Coming Soon...
